        <h1>The QR Code on the jeans does not work anymore. <br>It has expired.</h1>
        <br>
        <h2>Here's what happened.</h2>
    <br>
        <h3>Original Work</h3>
        <p>At the beginning of last semester, I made a project called <i>"Don’t Ask Me Anything Jeans"</i>, a pair of jeans with a QR code that leads to a website. On it is <a href="https://rawcdn.githack.com/terryrim1110/terryinstudio/737da9c9bf3534c6930b3d33e7f2b8e43fae2d6c/Don't%20ask%20me%20anything%20Jeans/index.html">a list of answers to all the questions I have been asked ever since I came to the US</a>. It was a lighthearted work of cynicism at the never-ending icebreakers at the start of every semester. </p>
    <br>
        <h3>What Happened</h3>
        <p>I simply went to the website that popped up at the top of the search result for ‘best QR code generator’. Their advertisement slogan “FREE QR Code” seemed like a good deal. Two weeks later, they sent me an email to accounce that my QR code was going to expire unless I upgrade to a paid subscription plan. The cheapest was $32.23 per month, totalling $96.69 for 3 months. Way too much money for a single QR code.</p>
        
        <!-- <p>I generated a QR code, printed it out on paper, made it into a stencil by cutting out every black square with an exacto knife, placed the stencil on a pair of jeans, and spray painted over it.
        It was pure labor, but I was pleased that the spray-painted QR code could be scanned. I felt like my time and effort paid off.</p>  
         -->
        
        <!-- <p>‘Didn’t they say it was free? They didn’t say it was a free trial.’ This was my first thought, which soon changed to ‘Yes I can do that for my project.’ I was thinking something like $9.99/mo, and I was ready to sacrifice 2 Starbucks drinks every month to make room for that extra subscription.</p> -->
            
        <!-- <p>When I got back to their website again to re-activate the QR code</p> -->
        
        <p>Only then I searched for some reviews for this company and found a handful of furious people who had to throw away their business cards and already printed QR signs. They called this company an "absolute scam". I should have looked up the review before I used their website. I should have read their terms and conditions. I should have been more prudent and careful, but it was too late. I should have, I should have. </p>
    <br>
        <h3>What I did</h3>
        <p>Rather than devoting another pair of jeans to spray-paint on a new QR code, I decided to gear this project toward something else; an anecdote about a downside of consumerism. This is an example of what happens when people are not as vigilant in the face of aggressive marketing practices. 

    <br>
    <br>
        <h3>Takeaways</h3>
        <p>The QR code on these jeans does not lead to my project page anymore.<br>
        But, at least, I can hope that you may learn from my failure to make a well-informed financial decision. <br>
        All in all, stay awake, fellow consumers! Know what you are agreeing to, and know what you are buying!
